## Shazam in Java

"Creating Shazam in Java" is a post from Roy van Rijn about a algorithm to implement Shazam in Java. There are many code snippets about his project, but not the entire project. 

Wiktor Sieroci≈Ñski has implemted a Proof-Of-Concept as a weekend project which outputs its findings to the console.

Based on Roys Post and Wiktors implementation I have implemented a exam project at the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences. The proejct is a prototype and not finished yet. It can store fingerprints in a database or put it out to a file/console. I have tested it with several mp3 files and the application was able to recognize each of them (just as Wiktor). 

This project is not finished yet. If you miss something, fork it or make a pull request.

The following libraries are necessary for this project:

* jl1.0.1.jar
* jtransforms-2.4.jar
* tritonus_remaining-0.3.6.jar
* tritonus_share.jar
* mysql-connector-java-5.1.34-bin.jar
* mp3spi1.9.5.jar
